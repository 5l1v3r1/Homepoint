# :heavy_check_mark: Features

- **See and trigger scenes** (groups of devices) on the front screen.

- **Trigger individual devices** by diving into scenes (by tapping the indicator or long pressing a button).

+ **See partially switched on scenes** with multiple devices at a glance.

+ Support for **temperature, humidity and air quality sensors**.

+ **HomeKit Switch Support** (Setup Automations in Home App to toggle from Homepoint).

+ Supports both **Touch Screen or Button based navigation**.

+ **Reactive**: Screen updates whenever devices are triggered from elsewhere.

+ **Easy configuration** through a JSON file, no additional code required.

+ **Screensaver** saves power by switching off screen after 10 minutes.

+ **Statusbar** shows connectivity for WiFi and MQTT as well as time.

# :house: Installation

Homepoint was created using the [ESP-IDF SDK](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

In order to build HomePoint you need ESP-IDF from the `release/v4.0` branch from the ESP-IDF git repository.  

| Software       | Version                                                                                                                 |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  ESP-IDF       | [release/v4.0](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v4.0))                                                           |
|  Toolchain     | [5.2.0](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started-cmake/index.html#step-1-set-up-the-toolchain) |
  
**Clone and build** HomePoint with the following commands:

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/sieren/homepoint.git
$ cd homepoint
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make spiffs_spiffs_bin
$ make -j 8 flash
```  

For use with a **Button-Based** interface:
```bash
$ cmake -DBUTTONS=ON ../
```

For out-of-the-box use with [**M5STACK**](https://m5stack.com/collections/m5-core):
```bash
$ cmake -DM5STACK=ON ../
```

Depending on your hardware, you may have to uncommented the relevant sections in `main/libraries/TFT_ESPI/User_Setup.h`.
  
Other Homepoint configuration settings like the Screensaver can be configured in `main/config/Config.h`.

<a name="configuration"></a>

# :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Configuration

The configuration lives in `data/config.json`.

## Devices & Scenes

HomePoint supports two types of Scenes with a selection of devices each:

| SCENE Types   | DEVICE Types                                                                             |
| --------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Light, Switch | (none, all devices expected to be switches)                                               |
| Sensor        | temperature, humidity, voc                                                                |

**Grouped Sensors** support up to two devices (due to screen space).  
**Lights & Switches** support an infinite number of devices in a group.

Some Sensors use **JSON** as a data-format, in which case a **key** can be defined.

## WiFi & MQTT Credentials

WiFi and MQTT credentials are to be defined on the top level.

## NTP Time (optional)

In order to set the correct timezone, copy & paste your [NTP TZ Setting](https://remotemonitoringsystems.ca/time-zone-abbreviations.php) to the `timezone` key.


<a name="examples"></a>

## Example

```json
{
  "wifi": "MyWifiSSID",
  "password": "My Wifi Password",
  "mqttbroker": "mqtt://192.168.1.2",
  "mqttusername": "mqttusername",
  "mqttpasswd": "mymqttpassword",
  "timezone": "CET-1CEST-2,M3.5.0/02:00:00,M10.5.0/03:00:00",
  "scenes": [{
    "name": "Living Room",
    "type": "Light",
    "icon": "livingroom",
    "devices": [{
      "name": "Side Light",
      "setTopic": "lights/hue/00:17:88:01:02:3c:2a:6d-0b/set/on",
      "getTopic": "hue/status/lights/Hue color lamp 1",
      "onValue": "true",
      "offValue": "false"
    }]
  },
  {
    "name": "Bedroom",
    "type": "Sensor",
    "icon": "door",
    "devices": [{
      "name": "Temperature DHT Sensor",
      "type": "temperature",
      "jsondata": true,
      "temperatureKey": "temperature",
      "getTopic": "bedroom/esptemp"
    }]
  }]
}
```

# :bug: Known bugs & issues :bug:

- ESP IDF 4.0 has not been released yet and is in influx. Therefore breaking changes might happen.

> If you find any bugs or need assistance, don't hesitate and open an issue :)

# :revolving_hearts: Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Just hack away and open a Pull Request.
But please follow the style of the code that's already there (ie. no tabs, spacing).

# :coffee: Buy me a coffee

I have developed HomePoint in my free time because I wanted to learn more about C++ on ESP32
and to solve a concrete problem in my smarthome.  
As development kept on going, I thought about ways to make this project open source and more accessible and user-friendly for the maker-community.  

If you enjoy using HomePoint or this work, consider a small donation. But don't worry, I'll continue working on this anyway ;-).
